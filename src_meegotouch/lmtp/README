This directory contains private parts (private as of today) of libmeegotouch
that are reused by the terminal. Namely those are MEditorToolbar and its
dependencies. Additionally, MEditorToolbar is modified to take QGraphicsWidget
instead of MWidget as the constructor argument, since the terminal does not
have any MWidgets.
